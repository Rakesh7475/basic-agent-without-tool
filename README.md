# Basic Agent Without Tool

This repository demonstrates a simple agent implementation using the Agent Development Kit (ADK).

## Files
- `hello_agent.py`: Main script to run the agent.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   - `python-dotenv`
   - `google-adk` (or your custom ADK package)
3. Set up your environment variables in a `.env` file (not included in the repo).
4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python hello_agent.py
   ```

## Notes
- The `.env` file is excluded for security. Add your own locally for API keys and configuration.
- Make sure the `google.adk` package is available in your Python environment.
